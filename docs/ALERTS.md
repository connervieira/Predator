# Alerts

This document explains the format used by Predator alert databases.

## Overview

Predator is capable of loading alert lists from both local files and remote sources. Alert lists come in the form of a JSON dictionary.

Here is a break-down of each value in an alert database:

- `rule`: Each top-level key in the alert database should be a license plate rule that will trigger the alert.
    - `name`: This is an optional value that contains a human-friendly name for this alert.
    - `description`: This is an optional value that contains a brief human-friendly description of this alert.
    - `author`: This is an optional value that contains the author name associated with this alert.
    - `source`: This is an optional value that describes where the information for this alert was sourced from.
    - `vehicle`: This is an optional value that contains information about the vehicle this alert is associated with.
        - `color`: This is an optional sub-value for the vehicle color (all lowercase, human-friendly name).
        - `make`: This is an optional sub-value for the vehicle manufacturer.
        - `model`: This is an optional sub-value for the vehicle model.
        - `year`: This is an optional sub-value for the vehicle year. This value should be an integer (0 for none).
        - `vin`: This is an optional value to specify the vehicle's identification number (all uppercase).
